[Database Builder](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-A3ueeULl8-database-builder)
- Create and Execute Database Migrations: I can help you create and execute database migrations to update the structure of your PostgreSQL database. This includes adding tables, modifying columns, creating indexes, and more.
- Rollback Migrations: If a recent migration didn't go as planned, I can help you roll it back to the previous state.
- Retrieve Current Database Schema: I can fetch and display the current schema of your database, allowing you to see the structure of your tables, columns, and relationships.
- Execute SQL Statements: You can ask me to execute specific SQL statements on your database. This is useful for querying data, updating records, deleting entries, and other database operations.
- Provide Database URL: If you need to connect to the database using external tools or applications, I can provide you with the database URL.
- Check Billing Subscription Status: After you sign in via OAuth, I will check your billing subscription status. I'll inform you about the 7-day free trial for this service and provide any necessary links for subscription management or purchase.
